# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## About

Project 3 for Udacity FEND - Arcade Game

This is an implementation of classic Frogger game where a player has to go cross to the river and avoid being hit by the evil beetles. They will score a point once they cross without getting hit.

It is a challenging version as the player will have 3 chances to score 5 points and the speed of the beetles going across the lanes increases randomly. This makes it more fun for players to try and challenge themselves and their friends.

## instructions

To run this game, open the index.html in browser (after cloning the project or downloading it as zip).

Use the arrow keys to move your player. The goal is to make the player reach the top (to the water) without being hit by any of the beetles. The score will increment each time and if hit, the it will be reset and a life will be deducted.
